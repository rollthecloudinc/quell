# Summary

Quell is a carbon free web editor that runs effiencently on sustainable energy resources. In addition to running on clean energy additional measures have been taken to significantly reduce energy consumption. Quell achieves this feat via neutralizing servers and databases removing these energy intensive rresources from the web hosting equation. In contrast to traditional websites our carbon free sites run completely in the browser and communicate securely directly with resources in the cloud when necessary. Quell is the editor of choice for [Slayful](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/druidcloud) our cloud hosted platform to reimagine the web without scope 1,2,3 emissions.

# Climate Aware

Quell is architected from the ground-up to be climate friendly, carbon free.

* Quell follows the [principles of green software engineering](https://principles.green/).
* Quell is built on [sustainability pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html) of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected).
* Quell is [serverless](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/verti-go) favoring [zero trust](https://aws.amazon.com/security/zero-trust/) [signed requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) directly in the browser.

# Rapid Dev

Quickly realize simple and complex carbon free web experiences using the quell editor.

## Site Builders

Site builders can create carbon free web experiences using the quell without knowing how to code.

### Collect

Prototype quell form to collect and store submissions.

## Developers

Developers can use quell as an app shell to orchestrate micro-frontends built with Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Any app compatible with [module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) can be used with quell. Module federation can also be used to extend the platform without hacking core using extensions. Extensions are Angular micro-frontends developed for the sole purpose of providing new plugin implementations.

### Orchestrate

Prototype using quell as a shell app to host Angular architects workflow designer micro-frontends.

### Extend

Prototype using quell to load extension with new content type at runtime from external site.
