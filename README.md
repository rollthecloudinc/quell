Introducing Quell, a sustainable and carbon free CMS that operates efficiently on renewable energy resources. Not only does Quell run on clean energy, but it also takes additional measures to significantly diminish energy consumption. This is accomplished by neutralizing servers and databases, eliminating these energy-intensive elements from the web hosting equation. Unlike traditional websites, our carbon free sites run entirely in the browser and securely communicate directly with cloud resources when necessary. Quell is the preferred editor for [Carbon Free](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/carbonfree), our cloud hosted platform that envisions a web without scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Everything needed for the swift development of energy sustainable websites is packaged in the [SPeaRhead](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/spearhead) template repository. Experience the power of Quell as we reimagine the internet with a focus on sustainability and reduced carbon footprint.

# Climate Aware

Quell is architected from the ground-up to be climate friendly, carbon free.

* Quell follows the [principles of green software engineering](https://principles.green/).
* Quell is built on [sustainability pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html) of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected).
* Quell is [serverless](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/verti-go) favoring [zero trust](https://aws.amazon.com/security/zero-trust/) [signed requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) directly in the browser.

## Developers

Developers can use quell as an app shell to orchestrate micro-frontends built with Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Any app compatible with [module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) can be used with quell. Module federation can also be used to extend the platform without hacking core using extensions. Extensions are Angular micro-frontends developed for the sole purpose of providing new plugin implementations.

### Orchestrate

Prototype using quell as a shell app to host a simple micro-frontend.
